The MXF Generic Container is a streamable Essence Container that can be placed on any suitable transport and stored.
SMPTE ST 379-1 defines the MXF Generic Container as the native Essence Container in MXF files.
SMPTE ST 379-2 defines the MXF Constrained Generic Container.
This document defines how SMPTE ST-2117-1 streams can be mapped in the MXF Generic Container and MXF Constrained Generic Container.

Other MXF mapping documents such as SMPTE ST 382 define how Audio can be mapped and synchronised with the video stream in the MXF Generic Container.

[**Recommendation** - This document should be split into two. An MXF mapping standard and an RP for using it.]{custom-style="smpte-ch-review-highlight"}
